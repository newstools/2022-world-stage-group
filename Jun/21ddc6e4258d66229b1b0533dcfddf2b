France midfielder Paul Pogba will leave Manchester United when his contract expires at the end of the month, the English Premier League (EPL) club announced on Wednesday. The Old Trafford academy graduate joined Juventus as a free agent in 2012, only to return four years later for a then world-record fee of 105 million euros (113 million dollars). But Pogba has had a topsy-turvy second spell with Manchester United and he will leave for nothing for a second time. “The club can announce that Paul Pogba will leave Manchester United at the end of June, upon the expiry of his contract,” Manchester United said at the start of a lengthy send-off statement on the club website. “Everyone at the club will like to congratulate Paul on his successful career, and thank him for his contributions to Manchester United. “We wish him all the best for the next steps on a remarkable journey.” Pogba scored 39 goals in 233 first-team appearances for Manchester United, who he first joined from French club Le Havre in 2009. A key part of the triumphant FA Youth Cup side of 2011, the midfielder joined Juve the following year and enjoyed a medal-laden time in Turin. Pogba returned to Old Trafford in 2016 but struggled to live up to the billing. The League Cup and Europa League in his first campaign back at Manchester United have proved to be his only silverware. The 29-year-old –– a FIFA World Cup winner with France in 2018 —- has been linked in the media with a return to Juventus. Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), Real Madrid, FC Barcelona and Manchester City are other clubs to have been linked with him in recent months.
