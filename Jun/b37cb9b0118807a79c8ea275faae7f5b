The Russian Government is not planning to stop gas supplies to any more countries at present, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, the Netherlands and Denmark are no longer receiving natural gas from Russia. For now, no new states would be added to that list, Peskov said. “The system works, the system was adopted, and those who receive gas are already working under the new system,’’ Peskov said. Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered a new payment system at the end of March in reaction to sanctions imposed on Moscow by Western countries in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The procedure required customers to open special accounts at the Russian state-owned Gazprombank. There they can pay their bills in euros or dollars as before. The bank converted the money into roubles and transferred it to Gazprom. The European Commission did not consider sanctions to be violated as long as companies made payments to an account at Gazprom in euros or dollars, as stipulated in the contracts. Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, the Netherlands and Denmark, however, refused to switch to the new scheme.
