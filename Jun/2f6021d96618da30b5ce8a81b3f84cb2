Meta, the parent company for WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, on Monday said it had launched a digital non-profit training programme for 1,500 NGO personnel across Anglophone West Africa. Meta, in a statement, said the digital capacity building programme was aimed at supporting the non-profit and social impact sector across West Africa. Adaora Ikenze, Head of Public Policy for Anglophone West Africa at Meta, said: “We know the value of digital skills and Meta is committed to helping non-profits and social enterprises across Nigeria acquire these skills. Ikenze said the company would provide them with information to increase their overall digital awareness. She said the training would also be helpful in providing visibility for NGOs. “We recognise the needs of these enterprises and we are excited to partner with NGOs who leverage our family of apps for impact. “We are delighted to provide the required support to improve their skills to scale and strengthen the work they do within their communities,” she said. The Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Investments, Maryam Uwais, said: “We commend the initiatives of Meta towards developing people working in the non-profit sector.” She said the investment would be deeply appreciated by the Federal Government of Nigeria, and that Meta had continuously partnered the government to make Nigeria a better place.
