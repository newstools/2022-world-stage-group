Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has committed fresh N150m to  the construction of at least 48 modern motorized boreholes and their accessories in Moro and Asa local government areas of the state. The investment complements the ongoing efforts of the administration to make potable water available to residents of the state. The gesture of the state government has led to the Federal Government offering to construct 20 solar boreholes in Edu and Offa local government areas, each getting 10 apiece to deepen public access to water. “This is just one of the findings from the budget review process this year. It is therefore worth informing the Kwara public that the government is committed to steadily meet their water needs in phases as our resources permit,” a statement quoted the Commissioner for Finance Hon. Florence Olasumbo Oyeyemi as saying.  “The spending on water aligns with His Excellency’s ongoing investments in Partnership for Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (PEWASH) and Open Defecation Free (ODF) campaign. These efforts are glaring and impactful, and we are making appreciable progress.”
