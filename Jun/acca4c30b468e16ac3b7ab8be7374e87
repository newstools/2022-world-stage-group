Chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat has extended condolences on the death of no fewer than 20 teenagers in South Africa. “Our hearts and prayers go out to the parents and loved ones of the teenagers who tragically lost their lives at a nightspot in South Africa over the weekend,” Mahamat said in a tweet. The AU Commission chairperson further emphasised that “we stand in full solidarity with the people and government of South Africa during this time of unspeakable grief and sorrow.” On Sunday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa mourned the “22 teenagers” at a tavern, or pub, in East London, Eastern Cape Province, in the early hours of Sunday. Ramaphosa is “concerned about the reported circumstances under which such young people were gathered at a venue which, on the face of it, should be off limits to persons under the age of 18”. The concern was expressed in a statement issued by the presidency. According to the statement, South African police are investigating the case but the cause is unclear. The statement added that the president was waiting for more information. Minister of Police Bheki Cele, who led a national delegation to the scene, said the victims were both girls and boys, including a 13-year-old. Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, which includes East London, earlier said over 20 young people died in the incident. It is the “worst tragedy that has ever happened in our Metro,” its mayor Xola Pakati said in a statement.
