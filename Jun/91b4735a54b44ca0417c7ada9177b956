This, he said was with the permission from INEC to save cost. “We want to make the whole process nearer to the delegates. The delegates are in the states. So that is why we decided that the primary election   will take place in the 36 states and the FCT. “Definitely, having it in the states, rather than bringing them here, is more convenient for them. “We set up 37 committees headed by the nominees from the national executive committee in the states along with the state organising secretaries to conduct this exercise in the states,” Bello said. Bello further said  the aspirants had promised to support whoever emerged as the party’s candidate. He added that the party decided not to zone its presidential ticket to any of the six geo-political zones across the country but to look for a candidate who was capable, competent and enjoyed wide acceptability across the country.
