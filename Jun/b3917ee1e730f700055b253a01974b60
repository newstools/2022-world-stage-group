G7 leaders have expressed serious concern about an announcement by Russia that it could transfer missiles with nuclear capabilities to Belarus. The leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States said they condemned Russia’s unjustified use of nuclear rhetoric and signalling. The leaders said this in a joint statement issued on the second day of a three-day summit in the Bavarian Alps. “Russia must abide by its international commitments, including those which ban the use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. “We urge Russia to behave responsibly and exercise restraint, and reiterate that any use of such weapons will be unacceptable and met with severe consequences,’’ the statement said. The comments come after President Vladimir Putin reportedly told Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, his closest ally in the war against Ukraine, that Russia would deliver missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Belarus in the coming months.
