WorldStage Newsonline– In furtherance of its efforts aimed at developing and improving sporting activities in the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), three Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) of the ranks of Flight Sergeant (FS) and Corporal (Cpl) are currently attending a 3-week Train-the-Trainer Practical Golf Coaching and Golf Course Maintenance course at Excel Golf Ltd Development Company in Gaborone, Botswana. According to a statement, the NAF personnel who are members of Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria (PGAN) include Flight Sergeant Pam Gyang, Corporal Abdalla Godfrey and Corporal Pam Felix. “At the end of the course which is both theoretical and practical, the 3 NCOs would be issued with Level 1 Coaching Course Certificate which would further enable them advance to the next higher level in the PGAN,” the statement said. “The training which is in tandem with one of the key drivers of the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao’s vision of “purposeful training and human capacity development” would further enhance the growth of golf in the NAF and by extension the Country. “It would be recalled that in 2021 on assumption of office, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao approved the nomination of 10 Senior Non-Commissioned Officers comprising Air Warrant Officers and Master Warrant Officers to attend pre-retirement training course at Unique 4-Part International Pre-retirement Training at GTC Group in the United Kingdom which was the first of its kind in the NAF. “These and many other welfare programmes have been initiated by the current NAF leadership to bolster the professional performance of NAF personnel in the fight against insurgency, terrorism and other forms of criminality in the country.”
