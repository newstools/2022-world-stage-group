Sweden plans to deliver more arms to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, as well as mine-clearing equipment, the Defence Ministry in Stockholm said on Thursday. In total, the support package was worth about 500 million Swedish kronor (48.7 million U.S. dollars). Sweden, which like its neighbour Finland applied for NATO membership in mid-May, had supplied Ukraine with various military equipment and goods on four previous occasions. This included thousands of anti-tank handguns, personal protective equipment, food, mine-clearing equipment, firearms and a naval target robot. The Swedes had  also provided financial support to Ukraine.
