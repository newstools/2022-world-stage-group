The management of Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has cautioned Nigerians against a fictitious website inviting unsuspecting general public to question and answer quiz that attracts monetary benefit. The Deputy Director, Public Relations Department of NRC, Malam Yakub  Mahmood, made this known in a statement issued on Saturday in Lagos. The statement said the purported online platform was completely false, hence baseless and unfounded, without credible source. It said: “This website with the link http://installmultilateral.top/nrcgovng/tb.php is completely a scam website. “This stock in trade is to defraud innocent people and tarnish the reputable corporate image of the organisation. “NRC hereby refutes that the fake website publication, orchestrated by scammers and fraudsters is to defraud unsuspecting members of the public as there is no question-and-answer quiz been conducted online by the NRC.” The NRC advised the general public to be wary, conscious and observant in order not to fall prey to unscrupulous internet fraudsters masquerading with fictitious websites.
