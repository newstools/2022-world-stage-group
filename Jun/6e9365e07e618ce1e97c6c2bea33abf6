National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), on Thursday, says it has received approval to establish anti- human trafficking clubs in all the 110 unity schools across the country. The Director, Public Enlightenment of NAPTIP, Mr Josiah Emerole, who disclosed this at a training in Asaba, said that the agency got the approval from the Federal Ministry of Education. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the four- day training was organised by NAPTIP, in partnership with Action Against Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants in Nigeria (A-TIPSOM NIGERIA). NAN also reports that A-TIPSOM NIGERIA is a Spanish project, funded by European Union (EU) to fight human trafficking. The training was also aimed at developing a standard reporting template for members of the trafficking-in-persons media corps and officers of press and public relations unit. Emerole also said that the clubs were established to expose teenagers to the term “human trafficking” , its dangers and the emerging tricks in trapping victims. He said that when the teenagers were enlightened, it would be difficult for them to be lured by foreign currencies and trafficked. The director said that the traffickers capitalised on victims’ ignorance to perpetrate their acts. “It is a crime with a profit of more than 150 billion US Dollars, hence the need for a fierce fight against it,” he said. He said that the agency would not relent in its efforts at protecting Nigerians, especially the youth, from the human traffickers. He said the agency would also ensure that it developed its capacity to beat any trend and trick developed by traffickers to trap their victims.
