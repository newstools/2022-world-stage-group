WorldStage Newsonline– The House of Representatives has queried the 49 million dollars contract for integrity test on Nigerian refineries awarded to Technimont company in 2019 by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Rep. Ganiyu Johnson, the chairman of the House ad hoc committee investigating the state of the refineries issued the query during a meeting with the company and NNPC officials on Thursday in Abuja. Johnson said that the company had failed to execute the contract properly as the state of the refineries were not verified. He also blamed the NNPC for failing to undertake regular turn around maintenance on the refineries leading to their current poor state. He asked the company and the NNPC to submit the contract documents, especially the approval by the Federal Executive Council and payment proofs including the level of work done to the committee for scrutiny.
