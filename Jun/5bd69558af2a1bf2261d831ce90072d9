The U.S. military presence in Europe is set for a long-term expansion, U.S. President Joe Biden says. “We’re going to make up sure that NATO is ready to meet threats from all directions across every domain, land, air and the sea,’’ Biden said. He spoke alongside alliance NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at a summit of NATO leaders in Madrid. Biden noted plans for increased U.S. troop deployments in the Baltics, the deployment of two squadrons of U.S. F35 fighters in Britain and additional air defences in Italy and Germany. Biden also announced the establishment of a permanent headquarters for the U.S.  Fifth Army corps in Poland. The announcement followed a U.S. decision to up the number of U.S. destroyers based in Rota, Spain from four to six.
