Olaniyan who described politics as free entry and free exit, added that all his political supporters prevailed on him to join the APC. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the new development has doused  tension and rumours over the sour relationship between the deputy governor and his boss, Gov. Seyi Makinde.
