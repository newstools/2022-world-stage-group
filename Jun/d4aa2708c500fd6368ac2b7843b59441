WorldStage Newsonline– Access Bank Plc has pledged to fund entrepreneurs, and create market access for small businesses across the country. A statement by the Deputy Managing Director of the bank, Mr Victor Etuokwu, in Abuja on Friday, said the bank remained resolute in its drive to engage and empower Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).
