In a dramatic twist on Thursday, a senatorial aspirant on the platform of the APC, OmoOba Segun Senbanjo, withdrew from the race and threw his weight behind the candidacy of Otunba Seyi Oduntan. Senbanjo, a friend and close ally of Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, made the declaration in support of Oduntan during the Ogun State APC governorship primary at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abeokuta, the state capital. Speaking with reporters, Senbanjo explained that he has officially notified the Senatorial Committee Chairman of his withdrawal from the Ogun East Senatorial race. Backing his speech with an official statement issued thereafter, Senbanjo noted that though he obtained nomination form and was successful at the screening exercise conducted in Abuja, he was stepping down from the race, to support Oduntan. Showing his total and complete endorsement of Otunba Oluseyi Oduntan for the Senatorial seat of Ogun East, he directed all his supporters to queue behind the candidacy of Otunba Oduntan in the primary election scheduled for Saturday 28th May, 2022. He also said he is grateful to Governor Dapo Abiodun, for his affection and leadership during his campaign and assured that he will work for the reelection bid of Governor Dapo Abiodun. Omooba Segun Senbanjo wishes to thank all his numerous supporters for their unalloyed encouragement and dogged fight so far, and wishes to assure them that there is more to come from him in the near future.
