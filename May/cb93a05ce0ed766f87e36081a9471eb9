Mr Mudashiru Obasa, the Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, has won the APC ticket to run for the 2023 Lagos State House of Assembly election. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Obasa, representing Agege 01, defeated his sole opponent, Mr Dada Olusegun, at the primaries held on Friday at Maternity Centre, Iloro, Agege. A total of 25 delegates comprised of five delegates each from the five Wards in the local government voted at the primaries. Mr Yinka Durosinmi, the party’s electoral officer who announced the result, said that Obasa scored 25 votes to emerge winner of the Lagos Assembly APC primary in Agege 01. “25 of them were accredited before voting and we ensured the voting exercise was conducted peacefully. “Though we had two candidates, Mudashiru Obasa and Dada Olusegun, but we only saw one agent representing Obasa and the other aspirant did not show up,” he said. According to him, Obasa, who is aspiring to return to the Lagos House of Assembly for the sixth time, cleared 25 votes to clinch the APC ticket. The speaker, who addressed newsmen after the exercise, described the victory as proof of his acceptance by his constituents. Obasa said that the primary was won because of the belief the delegates have in him as their true and passionate representative. “I thank the constituents for the trust they have in me. I am confident that I shall win in the main election.“Through this victory, we can continue with spreading the dividends of democracy we have attracted to Agege,” he said. Obasa also said he was sure that the party’s primary election to pick a presidential candidate would favour Sen. Bola Tinubu, a leading aspirant for the party’s ticket.
