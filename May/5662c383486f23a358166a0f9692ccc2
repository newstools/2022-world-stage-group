President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has proposed using Russian assets to finance the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We should leave no stone unturned, that is including, if possible, the Russian assets that we have frozen,’’ von der Leyen said on Tuesday, referring to the European Union’s sanctions on Russian individuals and entities. “This is not only about undoing the damage of Putin’s destructive fury. “It is also about building the future that Ukrainians have chosen themselves,’’ von der Leyen said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Ukraine belongs in the European family,’’ she said.
