The United States Consulate in Nigeria, in collaboration with Organised Basketball Network (OBN), is training young Nigerians between the ages 6 and 18 on basketball. Ms Jennifer Foltz, the US Consulate Deputy Public Affairs Officer, disclosed this during the opening ceremony of a four-day training programme, tagged: “Uplift Africa Youth Through Basketball Camp”, for Boys and Girls in underserved communities in Rivers State. Foltz said the basketball camp would provide 60 participants, aged between 6 and 18, the opportunity to learn about the sport, gender-based violence, inclusion of marginalised communities and build their communication, leadership and teamwork skills. Foltz said that sports will impact positively on young Nigerians and eliminate gender-based violence in the country. In his speech, Gov.
