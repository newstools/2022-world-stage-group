The U.S. President, Joe Biden, at a summit of four leading Indo-Pacific democracies on Tuesday called Russia’s war in Ukraine a global challenge. “This is more than just a European issue; it’s a global issue. At the same time, we’re navigating a dark hour in our shared history, “Biden said in Tokyo. Besides Japan, Australia and the U.S., India, which has a neutral stance on the Ukraine war and does not support Western sanctions, also took part in the deliberations. Biden did not explicitly address India’s stance on Russia in the public part of the summit. However, the U.S. and other Western countries are making efforts to persuade India to distance itself from Russia. India has traditionally had good relations with Moscow and buys a lot of Russian defence equipment.
