The United States (U.S.), Japan, Australia, and India plan to commit billions of dollars to infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific region over the next few years. The four leading democracies wanted to spend at least 50 billion dollars in aid or investment in infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region over the next five years. The Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said this on Tuesday after the conclusion of a summit of the four so-called Quad countries in Tokyo. The details of their meetings were unclear at first. They also wanted to strengthen their cooperation on natural disasters and make their satellite data available to countries in the region.
