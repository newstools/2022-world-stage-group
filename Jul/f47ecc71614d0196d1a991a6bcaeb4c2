The National Population Commission (NPC) on Wednesday said it would recruit three million ad hoc staff for the 2023 population census. Dr Abdulmalik Durunguwa, NPC National Commissioner representing Kaduna state, disclosed this during a town hall meeting on the trial census for 2023 in Kafanchan. Durunguwa said the website for the recruitment would be opened in September for interested applicants. He said the essence of the town hall meeting was to sensitise residents to the trial census to be conducted in Sanga, Jaba and Kachia Local Government Areas for Kaduna South Senatorial District. According to him, the trial census, which would run till month end, was a dress rehearsal to the 2023 population and housing census. He solicited the support and cooperation of all stakeholders towards the success of the trial census. He restated the commission’s resolve to deploy technology in conducting a population census that would be acceptable by all. “We seek your cooperation and assistance because without your support we can hardly achieve what we want. “The 2023 census is going to be different from previous ones. we are going to conduct a census that is uncontestable and acceptable by all “We are going to minimise human error to the bearest minimum with the use of technology,” he added. In his remarks, the Kpop Ham of Jaba, Danladi Maude, represented by Basunbo Audu, said the traditional leaders in the area would prevail on their subjects to cooperate with the enumerators. He noted that census was key to national planning and development, hence the need for NPC to get the support of all critical stakeholders. Other participants who spoke at the meeting commended the commission for the sensitisation and pledged to provide an enabling environment for the smooth conduct of both the trial and main census in the state.
