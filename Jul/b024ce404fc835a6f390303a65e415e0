In a condolence message by his media aide, Mr Femi Adesina, on Friday in Abuja, the president also condoled with the Government and people of Japan over the incident. Buhari joined all Japanese in mourning the loss of the country’s longest serving prime minister and outstanding leader, assuring the family of Abe of the prayers and thoughts of all Nigerians during this difficult time.
