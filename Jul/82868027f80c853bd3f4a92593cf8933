Raheem Sterling has returned “home” after swapping Manchester for London by signing for Chelsea on a five-year deal. The England international ended a seven-year stay at Manchester City as he joined their English Premier League (EPL) rivals on Wednesday. The Blues shelled out 47.5 million pounds to acquire Sterling, who won four league titles during a successful spell at the Etihad Stadium. Chelsea confirmed the deal from their pre-season camp in the U.S., with Sterling ready to get to work. “London is my home and where it all started for me, and it’s amazing I now have the opportunity to play in front of friends and family week in, week out at Stamford Bridge. “I’m really looking forward to meeting the fans there soon,” Sterling said in a statement published on the club’s website. Earlier, Sterling posted a goodbye message to Manchester City on Twitter, celebrating “seven seasons, eleven major trophies, a lifetime of memories.” Sterling joined Manchester City from Liverpool in 2015, winning four league titles and scoring 131 goals in 339 games across all competitions. The England International was in and out of the Manchester City team towards the end of last season. He did not start either leg of their UEFA Champions League semi-final loss to Real Madrid or the EPL title-clincher against Aston Villa on the final day. Sterling becomes the second long-serving Manchester City player to depart for London this summer after Gabriel Jesus completed a move to Arsenal. The pair scored 30 goals between them last season. But Pep Guardiola will be hoping to offset that loss following the signing of Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund earlier in the window. Sterling is Chelsea’s first major signing of the summer as Blues boss Tuchel looks to inject fresh impetus into an already impressive forward line. He could soon be followed by Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly, who is expected to complete his move to west London soon.
