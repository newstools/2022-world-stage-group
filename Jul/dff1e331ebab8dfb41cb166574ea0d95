WorldStage Newsonline– Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has disclaimed a fraudulent employment scheme currently making the rounds online, and especially on various social media platforms that it will soon commence ‘massive recruitment’ exercise. According to a statement, NIMASA informed the general public to utterly disregard such unfounded and false publication as “it is a scam being perpetrated by fraudulent agents and persons to mislead and exploit the unsuspecting public. “These fraudulent persons have also been known to contact innocent people through e-mail, social media and other forms of internet publication soliciting for payment, inducement, advance fees or other favours in exchange for employment. Victims stand the risk of extortion. “For the avoidance of doubt, any party that puts itself forward as acting on behalf of NIMASA for the purpose of recruitment is completely false and NIMASA disclaims and bears no responsibility whatsoever for their action. NIMASA does not communicate employment vacancies through third party online channels, emails or social media platforms. NIMASA hereby expressly disassociates itself from such fraudulent online publications and posts and warns the general public not to fall victims to such baseless and false schemes in the guise of employment opportunity. “Members of the public are hereby urged to treat with suspicion any such offerings and verify their claims in order not to fall prey to these scammers, as NIMASA has not designated any entity or persons to act on its behalf. Please report such incidents to info@nimasa.gov.ng or the appropriate law enforcement agencies. “NIMASA expressly disclaims any liability for any losses incurred by any person (s) as a result of reliance on such fraudulent e-mails/online publications.”
