The Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan, said Osun State in the last three and half years had witnessed great development and growth under the leadership of Governor Oyetola.

Governor Sanwo-Olu in his address said his Osun State counterpart had performed very well in his first term and he is deserving of another term. Sanwo-Olu, who is the Chairman of the APC National Campaign Council for Osun State Governorship election, said the electorate must vote and ensure that their votes count on Saturday. He said: “Governor Oyetola has performed extremely well. He is deserving of another term. I have gone on campaign train with him and from what I have seen and heard, he has done very well. “Don’t allow anybody to deceive you. There is no crisis in APC. We are united in our party. “I want to urge you all to vote for APC and Governor Oyetola on Saturday so that he can continue the good work he is doing in Osun State. By God’s grace, we will come back for victory dance on Sunday.” APC National Chairman, Senator Adamu while presenting the APC flag to Oyetola said the party is impressed by the good performance of the Osun State Governor and that is why it is supporting him for re-election. He appealed to genuine APC members and the electorate to turn out in large numbers on Saturday to vote for Governor Oyetola. “We are taking no chances and that is why we came out in full force to support our candidate, Governor Gboyega Oyetola.” “Governor Oyetola has done so much since assuming the office of Governor in Osun State. He did very well during his first term and he deserved to be re-elected. We pray for better performance in Osun than what we scored during the Ekiti State governorship election.” Speaking on behalf of the Progressives Governors Forum, the Chairman of the forum and Kebbi State Governor, Senator Atiku Bagudu, assured the people of Osun State of good governance if they re-elect Oyetola for second term.
