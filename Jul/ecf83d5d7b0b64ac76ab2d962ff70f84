A coalition of NGOs, the Kano First Forum (KFF) filed a motion exparte dated June 27, sworn by the Director-General of the Association Dr Yusuf Isyaka-Rabiu. KFF through its counsel, led by Mr Badamasi Suleiman-Gandu, prayed the court to restrain Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano from borrowing N10 billion loan. Other respondents in the suit are the Attorney General of Kano State, Commissioner of Finance Kano and Speaker Kano State House of Assembly. Others are Access Bank, Federal Ministry of Finance, Debt Management Office and Fiscal Responsibility Commission. Justice Liman on Friday granted the prayers of KFF and restrained the first respondent from borrowing the N10 billion loan and ordered all parties to maintain status quo. He also ordered the plaintiff to serve Federal Ministry of Finance, Debt Management office and Fiscal Responsibility Commission with the order and other court processes. The News Agency  of Nigeria (NAN) reports that KFF is challenging the Governor of Kano State from borrowing the sum of N10 billion on the grounds of non compliance with rules and regulations governing loan transaction.
