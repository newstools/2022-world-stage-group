COVID-19 vaccine makers, Pfizer and BioNTech, have announced a new $3.2 billion supply deal with the U.S. Government, as the country braces for a fresh wave of cases this autumn. Under the deal, the U.S. Government will initially receive 105 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The order may include adult Omicron-adapted jabs, subject to authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The agreed doses are planned to be delivered as soon as late summer 2022 and in the fourth quarter. The government also has the option to purchase up to 195 million additional doses, bringing the total number of potential doses to 300 million. According to Pfizer’s Chief Executivs Officer Albert Bourla, the new agreement will help to ensure that people across U.S. have access to vaccines that may provide protection against current and future COVID-19 variants. Trials of its vaccine adapted to Omicron have shown positive results so far, Pfizer says.
