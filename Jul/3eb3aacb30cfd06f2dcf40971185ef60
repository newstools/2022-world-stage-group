Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Friday that the Islamic republic would never back down from the rights of the country’s people in the talks on the revival of a 2015 nuclear deal. Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks in a tweet in reaction to a joint declaration signed by U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid in Jerusalem on Thursday. They vowed to stop Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran would continue the path of sustainable development and make honourable efforts to remove the sanctions with strength and logic, Amir-Abdollahian noted. He said Iran’s goal is to reach a good, robust and lasting agreement in the nuclear negotiations. The U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Joint Declaration was signed on the second day of Biden’s Middle East trip. The U.S. pledged not to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon even at the cost of using all elements of its national power. The U.S. affirmed its commitment to work together with other partners “to confront Iran’s aggression and destabilising activities, whether advanced directly or through proxies.’’ Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to curb its nuclear program in return for the removal of sanctions on the country. However, former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the agreement in May 2018 and reimposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, prompting the latter to drop some of its commitments under the pact. The talks on the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal began in April 2021 in Vienna but were suspended in March this year because of political differences between Tehran and Washington. After a three-month pause, the talks resumed recently in the Qatari capital Doha but failed to result in any agreement to settle the remaining differences.
